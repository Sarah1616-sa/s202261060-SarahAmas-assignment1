2. **Code Review & Best Practices**
   - Reviewed code for accessibility considerations
   - Suggested improvements for responsive design
   - Provided guidance on CSS custom properties for theming

3. **Documentation Support**
   - Assisted in writing README.md structure
   - Helped organize technical documentation
   - Provided templates for proper documentation format

4. **UI/UX Design Suggestions**
   - Recommended color schemes for light/dark themes
   - Suggested layout patterns using CSS Grid and Flexbox
   - Provided guidance on mobile-first responsive design

4. **Problem Solving**
   - AI helped troubleshoot issues with CSS layouts
   - Provided alternative solutions when initial approaches didn't work

### Challenges

1. **Over-reliance Risk**
   - Had to be careful not to accept all suggestions without understanding
   - Some generated code needed modification to fit specific requirements

2. **Context Limitations**
   - AI sometimes provided generic solutions that needed customization
   - Required providing detailed context for accurate suggestions

3. **Verification Needed**
   - All AI-generated code required testing and verification
   - Some suggestions needed adjustment for browser compatibility

   - Learned to evaluate and adapt AI suggestions

## Responsible Use & Modifications

### Review Process

Every piece of AI-generated code was:
1. **Read and understood** before implementation
2. **Tested** in multiple browsers and screen sizes
3. **Modified** to match specific project requirements

### Modifications Made

1. **Personalization**
   - Changed all placeholder content to reflect my actual information
   - Customized color schemes to personal preference
   - Added personal projects from my CV

2. **Code Adjustments**
   - Modified CSS values for better visual appearance
   - Adjusted JavaScript logic for specific functionality needs
   - Added comments to explain code sections

3. **Originality Ensured**
   - Project structure reflects my understanding of web development
   - Content is original and based on my actual experience
   - Design decisions were made based on personal preference

### Academic Integrity Statement

I confirm that:
- I understand all the code in this project
- I can explain any part of the implementation
- AI was used as a learning tool, not to bypass understanding
- All content accurately represents my own work and experience
- I have documented AI usage transparently as required

## Conclusion

Using AI tools in this project was a valuable learning experience. The assistance helped accelerate development while teaching new concepts and best practices. By critically reviewing and modifying AI suggestions, I ensured the final product reflects my understanding and meets academic integrity standards.
